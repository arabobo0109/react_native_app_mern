#A repository for the grocery app that i built using MongoDB, Express, Node, React and ReactNative as my very first full stack Project <br/>
 You can update the list of products, create a new category, create new User, Login, logout, navigate to different screens, <br/> 
 I have not yet figured out the post and get routes for orders. Apart from that All other Screens are done <br/>
